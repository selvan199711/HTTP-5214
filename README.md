I Have a Secret The Useless Web is a simple, playful website I built just for fun. It shows comic-style cards that reveal random superheroes when you click on them. The idea isn’t to solve any problem it’s just about creativity, animation, and design. Each card has bright colors, bold comic fonts, and funny sound effects that make it feel alive. I made it using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it even remembers your progress as you explore new heroes.
